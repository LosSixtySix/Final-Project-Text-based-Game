# Final-Project-Text-based-Game
A text based game based on DnD.


I really like video games and I would love to make my own games. I have always also been interested in old school based things, games, movies, clothes anything honestly. So a really old school type game would be a choose your own adventure text based game. I used to read choose your own adventure games as a kid so I think it would be fun to implement a small one using c# and the terminal. The functions of the game would be to accept user input to make decisions. It would also  display messages that would describe what is going on. It would also use random integers for combat, possibly maybe implement levels and upgrades. It would also need to create an inventory for the character to store items found and also be able to use those items and remove them possibly as well.
